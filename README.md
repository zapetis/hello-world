Hey there,
It is I Modine and my intergalatic flying machine!
What about Quiche Lorraine?

Quiche is a dog dyed dark green.

Has anybody seen
A dog dyed dark green?
About two inches tall
With a strawberry blonde fall
Sunglasses and a bonnet
And designer jeans with appliques on it?

Trying just one more thing to see how the branching works!
Curious Joe!!
